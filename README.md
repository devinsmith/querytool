# querytool
A simple GUI based SQL query tool

# Dependencies

The application is dependent on fairly obscure FOX UI toolkit. However it is
likely packaged for your distribution. See
[repology](https://repology.org/project/fox-toolkit/versions) for details.

On Debian based distros you can install the dependencies with apt-get:

```
sudo apt-get install libfox-1.6-dev
```
